QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab10.bin.)

ANSWER: The program computes the result of adding decimal number 12 to x00000 in R2 and storing it in R2. The first line specifies in which address the program will be stored (i.e. in x3000 and PC is set to x3000). Second line specifies clearing any value in R2 and making its value 0 (by ANDing it with x00000). Third line specifies adding decimal number 12 (x000C) to R2 and store result in R2 (i.e. storing xC in R2). Last line specifies the program to halt. Overall, the register that is modified is R2 and in the end, it stores the value of x000C (decimal number 12).


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: The ability to step through a program is useful for debugging since it specifies the current value stored in the registers and the program counter. It also specifies the next instruction that has to be performed and where to perform it. It provides a complete description of all the tasks performed in the current step and the task to be done in the next step. Thus, it's transparency while performing tasks is very helpful for debugging.
