Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

Answer 1: 	In Line 16, .ORIG was not written
		In Line 19, R2 was assigned to store contents of an unknown address ,which was out of range, and not -1
		In Line 21, the syntax of the code was wrong; there was an additional comma
		In Line 32, R5 was assigned to store contents of an unknown address ,which was out of range, and not 0
		In Line 34, BRpz was written instead of BRzp
		In Line 37, final answer was stored in an arbitary address and not in 'result'
		In Line 46, .END was not written
        


Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

Answer 2:	INPUT     : x300E
		OUTERLOOP : x3004
		INNERLOOP : x3005
		RESULT    : x300C



Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

Answer 3:	Using labels makes it easier to understand and debug the code rather than using explicit memory locations/offsets.
		Finding explicit memory locations tends to be cumbersome since calculating then lead to errors. 
		Thus, it makes more sense to use labels instead of explicit memory locations/offsets.
